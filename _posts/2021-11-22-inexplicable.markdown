10:44 pm. Pizza. 

Wednesday, maybe. Pizza was Friday. When Mom was too lazy to cook. When Coach took the team out after losing a tennis match. When elementary school teachers had some money to spare.<!--more-->

It was meant for celebrations. This wasn't one. 

Out the window, the world was black. I could only see myself and my dinner. I took a bite. It was salty, and not just because it was from a hospital cafeteria. I reached for napkins as tears silently rained down my cheeks, my hands, my pizza, my white collared shirt. 

They said you were strong. That you would get better.

You weren't the same. 

You seemed so invincible yet there you were, unable to sit up without help. What truly bothered me was your mind. Being unable to walk, I could comprehend. I could hold you up, guide your hand. Being unable to remember little details was a different issue. Your mind was like a black box, one that I had no power to mend. 

So close, but further apart than ever.

Like reaching for shadows in the fog.

Somewhere deep in my brain, you were already gone. Somewhere, circulating on some set of neurons, there was an inexplicable acceptance.  

How could I think such a thing?  You were right there in front of me.

But you faded away. Integrate my sadness over those fatal months, and you get enough grief to mourn a death itself. 

2:36 pm. I got the call. 

Five days, they said. Okay, I replied and put the phone back into my pocket. It was actually less than one. I couldn't tell if I was shocked. 

That inexplicable acceptance. 

Wednesday. There was a talent show that night. I was there to oversee it. Made sure everything was set up. Made sure concessions were being sold. We raised more donations than ever.

9:00 pm. To the hospital in a fifteen-year-old Toyota Sienna. Lights blurred past, flares in the night. Astigmatism or watery eyes? 

I stood outside the ICU door for a while before someone finally let me in.

You were there, but not really.

Your eyes were closed. You asked for water. I spoke. Did you hear me? Probably not. 

Did we ever say those words? I love you. Of course not. Not before, not even at that moment. It didn't feel right, somehow. Inexplicably. 

I grabbed your hand and tried to utter a word, but only silence came out. I had nothing more to say, and yet there was so much we needed to talk about.

Did I say goodbye, at least? I hope I did. Do goodbyes matter, if I never see you again? Only to the living, I suppose.

I hadn't eaten all day. Is the cafeteria still open?

Turns out it was. And all they had was pizza.

At 10:44 pm.


You were gone by noon the next day. 
 
Auntie drove me to the hospital. The monks were already by your bed. Someone told me not to cry. They were sobbing. 

What now? Auntie drove me home. I asked a friend to take me back to school so that I could pick up my car from the parking lot. 

There was a football game that night. I had made plans to go with someone. For some reason, I didn't cancel. It was the first, and likely last football game I attended. I was bored out of my mind. 

When I came home, there were dozens of people in the living room. They offered Buddhist blessings and prayer. 

Mom always chewed me out for this, but I never believed in an afterlife. Or any kind of god. 

In a way, I believed in destiny, however. Once, I tried to explain determinism to Mom, but I didn't know the right words in Vietnamese. The Big Bang, atoms, and kinematics. That's the universe.  You would have understood. 

These tears? They came from the lacrimal gland. Released by the order of neurotransmitters. These thoughts? More neurotransmitters. Electrical signals controlled by sodium ions. Life was just particles bumping into each other. 

Everything had been set in place since the creation of the universe itself. 

Well, that’s not quite true — quantum mechanics imply a probabilistic universe. 

Either way, though, nothing was within my control. The momentum of the atoms within my mind defined my grief. 

I was fine with this. Not that I could choose to be fine or not. Perhaps that inexplicable acceptance was not so inexplicable. 

You'll grow out of it, Mom said. You’ll understand more about the world when you’re older.

That's what they all say, I told her.

Always stubborn like your father, she tsked.

Yeah.

Years passed by. All this time I wanted to blame you for leaving when it was just a hell of my own creation. I’m sorry. I held it all in, that integrated sadness. 

Sorry for your loss. How are you feeling? Do you want to talk?

No.

Sometimes that integrated sadness overflows. Sometimes I'm left breathless, paralyzed, and with tear-soaked pillows.  


3:01 am.

Monday. I wrote something. It's rough. But maybe it's the best way to let you go.

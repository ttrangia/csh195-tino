# About

## Why does this site exist?

While I originally intended to create a resume/CV/portfolio website for professional purposes, I realized that my personal site should be, well, more _personal_. I also found myself repeating information that already existed on my resume and LinkedIn. Thus, this site has become more of a blog, one that offers a deeper, more holistic view of my experiences and thought processes. 

Additionally, I wanted to get some basic experience with front-end web development, particularly with HTML/CSS. This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). It's currently making use of the [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme, though I hope to develop my own theme at some point. At this moment, the site is _very_ work-in-progress, so please excuse any missing content or weird formatting that you might stumble across.

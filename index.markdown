# Hello, my name is Tino!

I (he/him) am currently a junior studying **electrical engineering and computer science** at the University of California, Berkeley. I've taken courses about data structures, computer architecture, databases, operating systems, discrete math, efficient algorithms, and more. Through course projects and outside resources, I have gained experience with Java, Python, C, SQL, RISC-V Assembly, and HTML/CSS. I'm a strong believer in exploring new opportunities, decolonizing STEM, and using tech (i.e. intellectual capital) for social good.

Aside from being a student, I'm currently a research assistant at the [Space Sciences Laboratory](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu), where I performed hardware testing for space-borne instrumentation and developed a Python-based data analysis tool for streamlining neutron imaging research. For the latter, I worked directly with physicists and researchers to optimize user experience, from improving load times to adding quality-of-life GUI features.

I've also been on the university's [Engineering Student Council](https://esc.berkeley.edu) for over three years, where I held the position of External Vice President and currently serve as Chief of Staff and Director of Facilities. Here's just a few of the projects I've worked on during this time, all with the goal of making the college atmosphere healthier and more accessible for students:

* Managed one of the largest storage and meeting spaces for student organizations on campus.
* Oversaw development of the [Blue and Gold Certification](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/students/student-life/teams-and-organizations/), a set of administration-endorsed policies for improving recruitment practices, increasing financial accountability, and promoting awareness of sexual harassment among engineering clubs.
* Launched the Free Menstrual Product Initiative, a widespread pad/tampon distribution program for addressing menstrual equity in the College of Engineering.

Now that the "boring" details are out of the way, you might be interested in learning more [about](https://www.tinotrangia.com/about/) me as a human being (and not as a resume), or in reading my [thoughts](https://www.tinotrangia.com/_pages/) on random topics.

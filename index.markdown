# Hello, I'm Tino Trangia!
I (he/him) am currently a junior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I've taken courses about data structures, computer architecture, databases, operatng systems, discrete math, efficient algorithms, and more. 

Aside from being a student, I'm currently a research assistant at the [Space Sciences Laboratory](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu), where I developed a Python-based data analysis tool for streamlining neutron imaging research and performed hardware tests for space-borne instrumentation. 

I've also been on the university's [Engineering Student Council](https://esc.berkeley.edu) for three years, where I held the position of External Vice President and currently serve as Chief of Staff and Director of Facilities. Here's just a few of the projects I've worked on during this time:

* Managed one of the largest storage and meeting spaces for student organizations on campus.
* Oversaw development of the Blue and Gold Certification, a set of administration-endorsed policies for improving recruitment practices, increasing financial accountability, and promoting awareness of sexual harassment among engineering clubs.
* Launched the Free Menstrual Product Initiative, a widespread pad/tampon distribution program for addressing menstrual equity in the College of Engineering.

Looks like the "boring" details are out of the way. If you're interested in learning more about me as a human being (and not as a resume), you can take a look at the [About Me](https://www.tinotrangia.com/about/) page or explore my [Thoughts](https://www.tinotrangia.com/posts/) translated to text.

This website was created in fulfillment of requirements for CS H195: Honors Social Implications of Computer Technology. It was designed as a resource hub for students at UC Berkeley to reflect upon the "Asian American" identity within the context of computer science education and the workplace.


#### Goals for CS H195 (as defined by Spring 2023 course staff):

* Build further on the CS 195 goals ("make informed and thoughtful choices about your careers, participation in society, and future development activities").
* Develop your "cultural competency" (awareness of social science topics such as identity, intersectionality, racism, bias, and discrimination; and how they affect both computing, technologies, and society).
* Create activities and discussions that you are invested in.

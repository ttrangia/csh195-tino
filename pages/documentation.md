*Note:* While most of these resources are from reputable sources, I encourage you to read them critically and avoid taking them at face value. You may not agree with all of the ideas presented in these readings, and that is important to discuss. 

## Important Definitions

These definitions are included here to provide context for readings and other discussions on this website. They are not intended to be authoritative - each definition is just one example, as these terms may be defined differently by other groups, institutions, and individuals.

**Asian:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.

*From US Census Bureau*

___

**Asian American:** The pan-ethnic term “Asian American” describes the population living in the United States who trace their roots to more than 20 countries in East and Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The term was popularized by U.S. student activists in the 1960s and was eventually adopted by the U.S. Census Bureau. It encompasses both the foreign-born and the US-born. 

*From Pew Research Center and UC Berkeley AAADS*

___

**Model Minority Myth:** A set of stereotypes that characterize Asian Americans as a monolithic ethnic group that is hard-working, highly educated, peaceful, and law-abiding. This myth is harmful because it crudely aggregates a wide variety of cultures and backgrounds, overlooks racism against Asians, and is often used to divide minority groups.

___

**Identity:**  The biological, physical, and social characteristics that define one's sense of self (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and religion).

**Diversity:** Individual differences (e.g., personality, prior knowledge, and life experiences) and group/social differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, and ability as well as cultural, political, religious, or other affiliations).

**Inclusion:** Active, intentional, and ongoing efforts that ensure everyone is welcomed, valued, respected, and able to reach their full potential.

**Equity:** The absence of unfair, avoidable, or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, geographically, etc. (World Health Organization)

## Important Definitions

**Identity:**  The biological, physical, and social characteristics that define one's sense of self (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and religion).

**Diversity:** Individual differences (e.g., personality, prior knowledge, and life experiences) and group/social differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, and ability as well as cultural, political, religious, or other affiliations).

**Inclusion:** Active, intentional, and ongoing efforts that ensure everyone is welcomed, valued, respected, and able to reach their full potential.

**Equity:** The absence of unfair, avoidable, or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically, geographically, etc. (World Health Organization)
